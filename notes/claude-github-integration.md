# Claude/GitHub Integration Guide

This document explains the Claude Code GitHub integration that has been set up for this project, providing AI-assisted development capabilities directly within the GitHub workflow.

## üéØ Overview

The Claude/GitHub integration provides two main capabilities:

1. **On-demand assistance** via `@claude` mentions in issues and pull requests
2. **Automatic code reviews** for all pull requests

This integration allows Claude to act as an AI pair programmer, reviewer, and assistant directly within your GitHub workflow, helping with code quality, bug detection, and development guidance.

## üöÄ How to Use the Integration

### On-Demand Assistance

You can request Claude's help by mentioning `@claude` in:

#### Issue Comments
```markdown
I'm having trouble with the database connection in the billing service.
@claude can you help me debug this error:

Error: pq: database "billing" does not exist
```

#### Pull Request Comments
```markdown
@claude please review this function and suggest improvements:

func (c *Client) Validate() error {
    // implementation here
}
```

#### Pull Request Reviews
```markdown
@claude this PR looks good overall, but can you check if there are any 
security issues I might have missed?
```

#### New Issues
Create an issue with `@claude` in the title or description:
```markdown
Title: @claude Help with Go testing patterns

I need guidance on implementing table-driven tests for the billing service...
```

### Automatic Code Reviews

Every pull request automatically receives a code review from Claude focusing on:

- Follows Anthropic's data handling policies

## üí° Usage Examples

### 1. Code Review Request
**Issue Comment**:
```markdown
@claude can you review this database connection code and check for potential issues?

```go
func NewDatabase(config *Config) (*sql.DB, error) {
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", config.DatabaseURL)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return db, nil
}
```

**Expected Response**: Claude will analyze the code and suggest improvements like connection pooling, ping testing, and proper error handling.

### 2. Debugging Assistance
**PR Comment**:
```markdown
@claude I'm getting this test failure and I'm not sure why:

```
=== RUN   TestClientValidation
    client_test.go:25: expected error for invalid email, got nil
--- FAIL: TestClientValidation (0.00s)
```

Can you help me understand what's wrong with my test?
```

**Expected Response**: Claude will examine the test code, identify the issue, and suggest fixes.

### 3. Architecture Guidance
**Issue Description**:
```markdown
@claude I need to add user authentication to the billing service. 

Current architecture:
- REST API with Gorilla Mux
- PostgreSQL database
- Docker containers
- OpenShift deployment

What's the best approach for adding JWT-based authentication?
```

**Expected Response**: Claude will suggest implementation patterns, security considerations, and code examples.

### 4. Performance Optimization
**PR Review**:
```markdown
@claude this PR adds a new endpoint that queries the database. Can you review it for performance issues?

The endpoint will be called frequently and needs to be fast.
```

**Expected Response**: Claude will analyze the database queries, suggest optimizations, and recommend caching strategies.

## üîß Integration with Existing CI/CD

The Claude integration complements the existing CI/CD workflows:

### Workflow Coordination
- **CI workflows** run automated tests and builds
- **Claude reviews** provide human-like code analysis
- **Security scans** detect vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot** manages dependency updates

### Typical PR Flow
1. **Developer** creates pull request
2. **CI workflows** run tests, linting, security scans
3. **Claude** automatically reviews code quality
4. **Human reviewers** focus on business logic and architecture
5. **Integration tests** run in staging environment
6. **Deployment** to production after approval

### Enhanced Debugging
When CI fails:
1. Check CI logs for errors
2. Mention `@claude` with error details
3. Claude analyzes logs and suggests fixes
4. Apply fixes and re-run CI

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Claude Not Responding
**Problem**: Mentioned `@claude` but no response

**Solutions**:
- Check if `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret exists
- Verify workflow file syntax
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Ensure correct repository permissions

#### 2. Incomplete Reviews
**Problem**: Claude's review seems superficial

**Solutions**:
- Add more specific `custom_instructions`
- Use `direct_prompt` for targeted feedback
- Enable specific tools with `allowed_tools`
- Consider upgrading to Claude Opus 4

#### 3. Too Many Reviews
**Problem**: Claude reviews every small change

**Solutions**:
- Add path filters to limit reviewed files
- Use conditional logic to skip minor changes
- Add `[skip-review]` to PR titles when needed

#### 4. Authentication Errors
**Problem**: "Permission denied" or authentication failures

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Refresh GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo,workflow

# Verify repository access
gh repo view Gaetan-Jaminon/GoTuto

# Check secret configuration
gh secret list
```

### Debugging Workflow Issues

**Check workflow runs**:
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=claude.yml

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

# Download logs
gh run download <run-id>
```

**Validate workflow syntax**:
```bash
# Use GitHub CLI to validate
gh workflow view claude.yml

# Check YAML syntax locally
yamllint .github/workflows/claude.yml
```
