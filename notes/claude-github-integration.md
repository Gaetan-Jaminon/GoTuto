### Branch Protection Integration

The workflows integrate with branch protection rules defined in `.github/settings.yml`:

#### Required Status Checks
```yaml
required_status_checks:
  contexts:
    - "Continuous Integration"           # ci.yml must pass
    - "claude-review"                   # Claude review must complete
    - "dependabot-check / dependabot-summary"  # Dependabot CI (if applicable)
```

#### Protection Rules
- **No direct pushes** to `main` branch
- **Pull requests required** for all changes
- **Status checks must pass** before merge
- **Admin override allowed** (for learning purposes)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### GitHub Settings App Issues

#### Settings App Not Applying Configuration
**Symptoms**: `.github/settings.yml` exists and is pushed, but repository settings remain unchanged

**Common Causes**:
- **Silent failures**: Settings app fails without error messages when there are YAML syntax issues, unsupported configuration options, or missing required fields
- **Branch protection incomplete configuration**: Each top-level element under branch protection must be filled or explicitly set to `null`. If any are missing, none of the settings will be applied
- **App reliability issues**: The original Probot Settings app has known reliability problems and doesn't always respond to changes

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# Check if Settings app is installed
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/installations

# Verify branch protection status
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection

# Check recent repository events for Settings app activity
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/events --jq '.[] | select(.type == "PushEvent" or .type == "CreateEvent") | {type: .type, created_at: .created_at, actor: .actor.login}'
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Validate YAML syntax** using an online YAML validator
2. **Start with minimal configuration** and gradually add settings
3. **Ensure all branch protection fields are complete** or set to `null`
4. **Consider alternatives**: GitHub's Safe-Settings app or manual configuration

#### Settings App vs Safe-Settings
**Original Settings App (Probot)**:
- ✅ Works with personal repositories
- ❌ Known reliability issues and silent failures
- ❌ Limited error reporting
- ❌ Not actively maintained

**GitHub Safe-Settings**:
- ✅ More reliable and actively maintained by GitHub
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ❌ **Requires GitHub Organization** (not personal repos)
- ❌ More complex setup with admin repository

**Recommendation for Learning Projects**: Use manual branch protection setup via GitHub UI for simplicity and reliability.

### Workflow-Specific Issues

#### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`) Problems
**Symptoms**: Tests fail, builds don't complete, security scans error

**Common Causes**:
- PostgreSQL service not ready (wait longer)
- Go module dependencies outdated (`go mod tidy`)
- Missing environment variables
- Path filters not matching changed files

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check workflow triggers
git log --oneline -5  # See what changes triggered workflow

# Update dependencies
cd api/billing && go mod tidy
cd api/billing-dbmigrations && go mod tidy

# Test locally
cd api/billing && go test ./...
```

#### 2. Dependabot CI Issues
**Symptoms**: Dependabot PRs fail, dependency conflicts

**Common Causes**:
- Dependency incompatibilities
- Breaking changes in new versions
- Go module conflicts

**Solutions**:
- Check Dependabot PR description for breaking changes
- Test locally: `go get [dependency]@[version]`
- Use `@claude` to analyze the specific dependency update

#### 3. Claude Workflows Not Triggering
**Symptoms**: No automatic reviews, `@claude` mentions ignored

**Common Causes**:
- OAuth token expired or missing
- Workflow file syntax errors
- Trigger conditions not met

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check workflow syntax
gh workflow list
gh workflow view claude.yml

# Verify OAuth token exists
gh secret list | grep CLAUDE

# Check recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=claude.yml
```

### Common Issues

#### 1. Claude Not Responding
**Problem**: Mentioned `@claude` but no response

**Solutions**:
- Check if `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret exists
- Verify workflow file syntax
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Ensure correct repository permissions

#### 2. Incomplete Reviews
**Problem**: Claude's review seems superficial

**Solutions**:
- Add more specific `custom_instructions`
- Use `direct_prompt` for targeted feedback
- Enable specific tools with `allowed_tools`
- Consider upgrading to Claude Opus 4

#### 3. Too Many Reviews
**Problem**: Claude reviews every small change

**Solutions**:
- Add path filters to limit reviewed files
- Use conditional logic to skip minor changes
- Add `[skip-review]` to PR titles when needed

#### 4. Authentication Errors
**Problem**: "Permission denied" or authentication failures

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Refresh GitHub CLI authentication
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s repo,workflow

# Verify repository access
gh repo view Gaetan-Jaminon/GoTuto

# Check secret configuration
gh secret list
```

### Debugging Workflow Issues

**Check workflow runs**:
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=claude.yml

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

# Download logs
gh run download <run-id>
```

**Validate workflow syntax**:
```bash
# Use GitHub CLI to validate
gh workflow view claude.yml

# Check YAML syntax locally
yamllint .github/workflows/claude.yml
```
